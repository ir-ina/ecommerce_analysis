I conducted an analysis of the dataset, including demand forecasting (using Prophet, Gradient Boosting, SARIMA) and sentiment classification of the reviews (using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil.
